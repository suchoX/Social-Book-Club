Desert Royal is the third book by Sasson, which revolves around the life of Princess Sultana behind the veil. In the previous books of the series, the readers were provided with shocking insights into the lives of those who are a part of Saudi Arabia’s royal family. Although royal women are fabulously wealthy, they are virtually prisoners under subjection to the male members of their family, including their sons.

When Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital ward with no memory of the last few days, he realizes that his memory loss is the least of his concerns. He is in Florence, Italy, and Sienna Brooks, one of the doctors tending to him informs him that he had been shot. He must figure out why, and what the shooting has to do with the strange object he had been carrying. Dr. Brooks and Langdon have little time, they are being hunted by unknown pursuers and only Langdon’s knowledge of Florence’s hidden passageways can save them. Guided by a few lines from Dante’s Inferno, they must decipher a string of codes hidden in some of the most famous artefacts of the Renaissance, and find the answers to save the world. Once again Robert Langdon’s expert knowledge of symbols and history becomes the sole pillar upon which the world’s future rests in this rapid chase against time.

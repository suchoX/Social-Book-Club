Princess Sultana’s story of escape and the gender inequalities experienced by Saudi Arabian women has won the sympathy of readers around the world. In this sequel, Sultana is now married to a prince. However, this does nothing to help her or her daughters face the inequalities of the country’s repressive laws. Sultana is a devout Muslim, but she believes that the patriarchal laws stem from the sadistic male nature rather than religious doctrine. One of her daughters succumbed to this system, turning to orthodox religion. The other mentally broke down because of it. This book is a stern reminder of the need for gender equality and speaks about societies which let their patriarchal nature destroy female freedom.

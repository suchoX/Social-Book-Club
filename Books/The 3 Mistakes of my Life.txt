The 3 Mistakes Of My Life revolves around Govind, Omi, and Ishaan. Although they have different personalities, their love for cricket unites them. They decide to start a shop that sells cricket-related items. Omi’s father is a priest at the temple, and has a great deal of influence there. They then decide to launch their shop in the commercial premises of the temple. The three are very close to each other. Things take a turn with the horrendous earthquake in Gujarat, the Godhra incident, and the riots that followed. This book revolves around the three mistakes made by these young lads, what they are, and the way it alters the course of their lives and that of those around them. The 3 Mistakes Of My Life was greatly appreciated by its readers, and was adapted into a movie titled Kai Po Che!, which was released in 2013.
